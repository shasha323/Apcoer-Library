        Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future is a 2014
        book by the American entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel co-written
        with Blake Masters. It is a condensed and updated version of a highly
        popular set of online notes taken by Masters for the CS183 class on
        startups, as taught by Thiel at Stanford University in Spring 2012.

      <p class="book-description">
        A character as well known and controversial as Peter Thiel is at
        something of a disadvantage as an author. The reader should maintain
        an open mind and evaluate Thiel’s opus critically.

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p class="chapter-text">
          The future is a time when things will look differently than they do
          today. By this definition, the future might not happen for another
          100 years if nothing changes. On the other hand, the future might
          come tomorrow if there is rapid change. We don't know much about the
          future, but we do know that it will be different from the present
          and that it will emerge from today's world. There are two different
          kinds of progress. Horizontal progress occurs from copying things
          that work. It's going from one to n, so that if you have a
          typewriter and then you build 100 more, you've achieved horizontal
          progress. Vertical progress is achieved by doing something wholly
          new. It means going from zero to one. This kind of progress is hard
          to imagine, because it's something that's never been done before. If
          you have a typewriter and then you build a word processor, you've
          achieved vertical progress. Globalization—taking things from one
          place and applying them everywhere else—is horizontal progress.
          Vertical progress comes from technological breakthroughs, and
          “technology,” by the way, doesnt just describe computers. Any new
          way of doing things can be called technology. Globalization and
          technology are two different kinds of progress that might or might
          not happen concurrently. You can have one type without the other,
          you can have both, or maybe neither of them. Between the two kinds,
          technology will be the defining force of the future. There's a
          tendency to imagine that we're nearing some sort of end state. Even
          the expression “developed world” implies that some countries have
          climbed the mountain and that “undeveloped” countries just need to
          catch up. Our technology isn't sustainable, however, especially if
          everyone else adopts it. We have limited resources and our
          environment can't endure the pollution that level of “development”
          would generate. Globalization without advances in technology would
          devastate the planet. At one time, people thought technology would
          continue to improve in all directions. We wouldn't have to work so
          many hours, we'd be riding in flying cars, we'd be taking vacations
          to the moon. The only area that's seen real vertical progress,
          however, is computer technology. Progress isn't a given; it doesn't
          happen automatically. We must first imagine and then create the
          world in which we want to live. New technology comes from startups.
          Big organizations lumber around uselessly, and individuals don't
          have the resources to create an entire industry. Small, agile groups
          foster innovation'
